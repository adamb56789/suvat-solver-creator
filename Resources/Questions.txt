There are 126 floors in Adam Tower, and the ball is dropped from the top floor at floor level. To find out how high off the ground the ball was dropped we just have to multiply 125 by 3, which is 375 m (125 because the height of the top floor is not included). The sensor is placed at floor level of floor 71, so we use the same technique to work out how high off the ground that is. 70 multiplied by 3 is 210 m. Once we know the heights of the sensor and the ball, we can subtract the height of the sensor from the height of the ball to get the distance that the ball fell. This is 
 m, so s = 
. The ball starts off not moving, so u = 
. We know that the acceleration due to gravity is 
 m/s/s, because we know for sure that Adam Tower is on the Earth - it is a wonder of the world after all.

The kangaroo can reach

, because that will be the velocity of the kangaroo for an infinitesimal amount of time at the peak of the jump. G was 9.81 m/s/s, but we have to make it negative, because the takeoff speed of the kangaroo will be in the upward direction, but gravity is acceleration in the downward direction. This means that a =
